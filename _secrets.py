“I don’t know when it started. At First it was the fish vans, at least that’s what nana told me. I was young, younger at least, so the memories are fuzzy, like those frosted windows. I was about 7 or so? And, I think I had gone to the dentist, and since I had done a good job or, whatever thing was told to me by my grandma to excuse her spoiling of me, she took me to get sundae’s at a small diner in town, Mackey’s I think, is that still there? I was sat outside, watching the small cherry eye’d face melt under the sun when, this, van came down the road, no name on it just, had a fish on the side. I remember wondering out loud when we got into seafood but my nana had just gotten quiet. She took my hand and we moved across the street, I remember only worrying about my ice cream id left on the bench, I remember crying but getting quickly distracted when I noticed dozens of the white vans speeding by. The windows were dark, don’t remember too much about the walk home but I remember that there was something wrong with one of the people outside of our house, just remember kinda looking at em through the window and nana rushing over to shut the window with the landline sandwiched between her shoulder and her oily hair, she was stressed and sweating a lot. Shortly thereafter we got a knock on the door and told we needed to leave immediately and not to pack our bags. With no hesitation she grabbed me, and quickly stopped grabbing a brass crucifix she had above the doorway, reaching on her tippy toes to grab it off the wall. We then got in the weird Beat up van she had sitting in the driveway since I was 5. I remember being surprised because all of our stuff was in there, even grandpa’s, and snacks. I kept asking when we could go back to Mackey’s to get ice cream. 
“Not right now honey bug, I think we’re gonna be leaving town for a long time.”

“Will grandpa know where to find us?” 

“He will always find us” 

I looked down happily with this answer, she was so sweet lying for me

As we were driving I was putting my index and middle finger out and, putting it against the window facing down like my hand was a little man running, I remember this vividly because I remember my little hand man running and jumping over people on the sidewalk, but one made me pause, as the shapes zipped and blurred by, I could’ve sworn one of the people walking on the street, was upside down. I’m not talking like, body upside down or on the ground, he was walking on his hands, and strolling like a regular dude. He looked as if this was the most regular day he’d ever experience. I stopped looking out the window after that. I cowered in my blankets my grandma had brought with us, one with my grandpa’s name on it. I fell asleep after a while of being hiding from the monsters outside in a whirring metal box gliding down the highway, losing worries about us being a tuna can waiting to be pried open. The little innocent things we tell ourselves as kids, the monsters we make up to shield ourselves from the true horrors of the outside world.”
